# Clear the Dungeon

Clear the Dungeon is a solitaire card game played with a standard 52 card French deck. The goal of the game is to successfully remove the monsters (face cards) from the dungeon (tableau). This is done by building up an attack on the tableau with cards from the draw pile and triggering it with a card that matches in suit.
